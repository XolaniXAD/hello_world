From a young age, I’ve always been drawn to the logical and problem-solving aspects of Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
These subjects ignited a curiosity within me, a desire to understand the underlying principles that govern our world.However, after matriculating with a bachelor pass in 2022, financial constraints prevented me from pursuing further education.

In 2023, I took a different path. I joined the Believers Care Society, a youth development center, where I completed two IT courses - Cisco IT Essentials and the CompTIA A+ certification. 
This was a turning point in my life, opening doors to new opportunities and experiences.

I want a career in coding because it aligns with my love for problem-solving and logical thinking. Coding, like Mathematics and Physical Sciences, presents mental challenges that I thrive on. 
It’s a field where continuous learning is a necessity, and that excites me. 
Moreover, coding has the potential to create significant positive impact, and I want to contribute to that. I believe that with my strong foundation in IT and my passion for problem-solving,
I can excel in this field and create solutions that make a difference.
