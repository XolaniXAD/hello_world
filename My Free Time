In my free time, I’ve found a balance between my passion for teaching and my personal interests.
I tutor students in Maths and Physics, subjects that have always sparked my curiosity.
It’s rewarding to see these students conquer concepts that once seemed daunting. It’s like solving a complex puzzle, and the satisfaction that comes with it is unparalleled.

When I’m not tutoring, you’ll find me immersed in the world of anime and manga. 
The intricate plots, the diverse characters, they offer an escape, a chance to experience different perspectives. It’s a fun and relaxing way to unwind.

But that’s not all. I also have a keen interest in quantum physics. 
I often find myself on YouTube, diving deep into videos that explore this fascinating field. It’s like peeling back the layers of the universe, one quantum particle at a time.

And when I’m in the mood for some trivia, I look up general facts.
It’s like adding to my mental library of knowledge, and who knows when these facts might come in handy.

So, that’s a glimpse into how I spend my free time. 
A mix of teaching, exploring my interests, and just chilling out. 
It’s this balance that keeps life interesting and fuels my passion for learning.
After all, every day is a new opportunity to learn something new, solve a new problem, or explore a new world. And that’s what makes life truly exciting.
