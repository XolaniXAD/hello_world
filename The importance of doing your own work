Copying someone else’s work is a bad idea for several reasons.
It’s not only wrong, but it can also land you in hot water.
This could range from getting a failing grade to facing serious consequences like expulsion or job termination. 
Moreover, when you copy, you rob yourself of the opportunity to learn and grow. You don’t gain any new knowledge or skills, which are crucial for personal and professional development.

On the other hand, taking the time to fully understand things is a smart move. 
It might require more effort and patience, but the payoff is huge. When you truly understand a concept, you’re able to apply that knowledge in different situations.
This adaptability is a valuable skill in many areas of life. Plus, the more you understand, the easier it becomes to learn new things. So, investing time and effort in understanding is definitely worth it.
