My daily routine is as the following:
I wake up at 5am just to prepare myself and my younger sister.
After the preparation I walk my younger sister to school at 7am.
I then head straight to the internet cafe where I work at around 7:35am.
I then work from 8am up until 6pm. During my lunch, I fetch my younger sister at 1pm and then go back to work at 2pm.
After work, I attempt to learn the basics of Javascript and complete my pending tasks at 7pm.
Before going to bed at 10pm, I read a book about hope and finance.
Basically this is the cycle I live through with the minor differences during the weekend where I sommetimes spend a little time on recreational activities.
