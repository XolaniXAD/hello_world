I was born on the 27th of May 2004 at Alexander Hospital and am the second child of Petunia Maluwa and the first of Tobias Melusi Dube.
My early years were spent under the care of my father, following my parents’ separation a few years after my birth although I would often visit her and my older brother from her side.

From my early schooling years, I was recognized as a “bright” child. 
Despite the instability of frequently changing schools due to shifting residences, my academic prowess remained undeterred.
This phase of constant change finally settled when I enrolled at Forest High School. 
It was the only school where I experienced a complete academic journey from start to finish.

I had a particular affinity for subjects like Mathematics and Physical Sciences. 
These subjects sparked my curiosity and presented me with the mental challenges I thrived on. 
My academic journey in high school culminated in 2022 when I matriculated with a bachelor pass. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to secure the necessary funding to pursue tertiary education for the years 2023 and 2024.

In 2023, my mother unfortunately passed away due to an ilness. 
It was to really hard on me and my brothers. However, we had to stay strong and live life for her sake.

In that same year, I took a different path. 
I joined a youth development center called Believers Care Society, where I completed two IT courses - Cisco IT Essentials and the CompTIA A+ certification. 
This step marked a new chapter in my life, opening doors to new opportunities and experiences.
