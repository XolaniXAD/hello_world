As capable as I am, unfortunately I also suffer from some shortcomings of which some are my fault and others not much so.

While it is good knowing that I learn everyday even if it is just for a brief period of time,
it is also somewhat my downfall. Little progress sometimes make me miss deadlines or goals and hence I must be dedicated towards increasing my study and practice time.

I sometimes lack data at critical times to effectively do some of my tasks although I try to overcome this by tutoring my students as a side hustle in order to acquire some money.
I also work at an internet cafe just for extra money in order to stay online.

These hindrances might end up throwing off my goal to get into software development and hence I should do my utmost best to be triamphant.
