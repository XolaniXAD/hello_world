I am Xolani Antony Dube.
I am 19 turning 20 this year and I intend to make the most with my time as a youth.
I strive to learn and improve myself even though sometimes learning something i have never done before can be so challenging(coding).
Pressure, however is an essential ingredient in forming diamonds and basically, staying in my comfort zone is detrimental
