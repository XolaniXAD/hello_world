In 2023, I started learning about computers and networks with a course called Cisco IT Essentials. 
It taught me the basics, like how computers work and how they connect to each other.
I wanted to learn more, so I got a certification called CompTIA A+. It helped me understand even more about computers and how to fix common problems.

Now, I can do things like installing Operating Systems and fixing simple network issues. I am a bit familiar with the Linux Operating System particularly the Ubuntu version and I can also use client side virtualization
I may not be an expert in fixing hardware yet, but I know enough to help out. 
I also spent some time volunteering at Believers Care Society, helping others with technology.

I'm excited to keep learning and growing in the IT field. 
I want to use my skills to make a positive impact in the world. With my passion for learning and hard work, I know I can succeed in whatever comes next.
